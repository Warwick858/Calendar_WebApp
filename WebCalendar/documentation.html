			 <td class="ob_table_data1">Game Grid via JS w/ CSS</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">My Game grid is displayed on the "game_grid_js.html" page.  It is generated via JavaScript in the "view.js" file in a function called, 
										"createCalendar()".  The CSS for this grid can be found in "project.css".</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">User Input: text, select, buttons</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">When the user clicks on a given day, then clicks the "New Task" button located on the day div, it displays another div which allows for 
										user input via text and select
										options.  Buttons are used throughout this sequence of events.  A similar process is found when the user hits the "Add" button on the 
										employee key div located to the left of the calendar.</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">User Input: mouse clicks</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">The user gives input everytime they click on the desired day.  Also, the last/next month buttons, which allows the user to navigate to
										the desired month, is based on a mouse click event.</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">Dynamic Modification of HTML</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">There are many instances of dynamic HTML modification, but one of the more obvious cases can be found by clicking the "Add" button on 
										the employee key, then completing the "New Employee" form and clicking the save button.  This causes the user given data to be 
										made into an Employee object, which is then injected into the existing
										list of employees.</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">XML</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">The XML can be found in the calendar as italicized, grey text.  The data is pulled from XML tags in the "maintenanceSchedule.xml" file.
										The implementation of this xml is found in the "view.js" file in a function called, "getXML()".</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">HTML 5</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">Internal Storage is used to save the data from the calendar, so the user can retain previously given data even if the application is closed.
										The logic for internal storage use can be found in the "model.js" file, in functions: "getLocalStorage()", "stringToArray()", 
										"saveDataToLocalStorage()", "arrayToString()", "clearDataFromLocalStorage()".  This process was quite challenging because I had to convert
										a 4D array with complex objects at two different levels, into a string and back to its original form :)</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">Game Logic</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">There is so much logic involved so I will list the primary functions: When the page first loads the current DateTime is generated, which is 
										then used to calculate the number of days in the month, the day div headers, the main calendar title, etc.  A Month object is generated which
										contains the month name, year, and a 3D data structure for that particular month;  User clicks the last/next month
										buttons which repeats the previous process; User clicks on any given day which displays day div, pulls data from the data structure,
										and populates the day div; User clicks on "New Task" button which displays the "New Task" div, allowing the user to give input and create a task; 
										The user clicks the "New Task" save button which creates a task object, adds it to the primary data structure, then repopulates the day div task list;
										User clicks the "Add" button in the employee div which opens the "New Employee" div;  Again, the "New Employee" div allows for user input
										and creates an Employee object, which is then appended to the employee div.</td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr class="ob_table_row">
			 <td class="ob_table_data1">HTML 5 EXTRA CREDIT</td>
			 <td class="ob_table_data2">Since I already took a considerable amount of time to implement the local storage functionality, I decided to add a little audio
										to satisfy the extra HTML 5 media element.  When the user creates a new task, and saves it, a ding sounds to inform the user that their task		
										was saved.  In addition, when the user clicks the big red button to the right of the calendar which clears all the local storage, a 
										sinister laugh sounds to inform the user the clearing of local storage was completed.</td>
