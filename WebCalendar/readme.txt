XML Documentation:

• File Name: maintenanceSchedule.xml

• File Folder: main directory

• Purpose: The data parsed from the XML file represents the maintenance schedule for
		the bowling alley.  These are tasks that will not be completed by my
		regular staff, but are included on the employee calendar so my staff
		is aware of the dates when they will be completed.

• Location: The XML data can be found in the calendar, on every day except Sundays.
		This data is displayed directly in the cells as red text.

• XML JS Code: The code associated with the XML work is found at the end of my view.js
		file, in a function called, getXML().  Here you will find my use of 
		XMLHttpRequests and so forth.

P.S:  Try the "Last Month" and "Next Month" navigation buttons :)
